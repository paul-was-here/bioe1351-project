ard_accelerometer contains Arduino code (.ino) to read analog voltage values from the 2-axis accelerometer, along with MATLAB (.m) code for live plotting this data.

ard_analog_write_pwm contains Arduino code that converts a desired analog output voltage into a digital PWM signal. Low-pass filtering this signal should yield the original desired analog voltage.

ard_heartrate_spo2 contains Arduino and MATLAB code for communicating with and live-plotting data from the HR & SpO2 board.
